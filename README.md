<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

What inspired us to make this website is that we knew that highschool can be confusing and stressful at times. So we made a website about highschool education in order to clear things up.We also saw many articles about the opportunity gap in the topic of education. "Children born into the top fifth of the income distribution have about twice as much of a chance of becoming middle class or better in their adult years as those born into the bottom fifth (Isaacs, Sawhill, & Haskins, 2008). One way that lower-income children can beat the odds is by getting a college degree." So, we provided resources in our website that could be possible solutions to attack these problems.
